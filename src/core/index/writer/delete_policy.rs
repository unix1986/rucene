/// Expert: policy for deletion of stale `IndexCommit index commits`.
///
/// Implement this interface, and pass it to one
/// of the `IndexWriter` or `IndexReader`
/// constructors, to customize when older
/// `IndexCommit point-in-time commits`
/// are deleted from the index directory.  The default deletion policy
/// is `KeepOnlyLastCommitDeletionPolicy`, which always
/// removes old commits as soon as a new commit is done (this
/// matches the behavior before 2.2).
///
/// One expected use case for this (and the reason why it
/// was first created) is to work around problems with an
/// index directory accessed via filesystems like NFS because
/// NFS does not provide the "delete on last close" semantics
/// that Lucene's "point in time" search normally relies on.
/// By implementing a custom deletion policy, such as "a
/// commit is only removed once it has been stale for more
/// than X minutes", you can give your readers time to
/// refresh to the new commit before `IndexWriter`
/// removes the old commits.  Note that doing so will
/// increase the storage requirements of the index.  See <a
/// target="top"
/// href="http://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/LUCENE-710">LUCENE-710</a>
/// for details.
///
/// Implementers of sub-classes should make sure that `#clone()`
/// returns an independent instance able to work with any other `IndexWriter`
/// or `Directory` instance.

    /// index directory and calls this method.  The policy may
    /// choose to delete some of the commit points, doing so by
