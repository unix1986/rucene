/// *NOTE:* the generic `C: Codec` here is used for `create_weight` methods. Actually
/// it should be placed as a method generic parameter, but this will restrict the `Query`
/// type be put into trait object. It's common for use to define custom `Query` type and
/// put it into composite `Query`s like [`BooleanQuery`], so we must ensure that `Query` could
/// be boxed. So for almost every case you just impl it like this:
/// ```rust,ignore
/// use rucene::core::search::query::Query;
/// use rucene::core::codec::Codec;
///
/// struct MyQuery;
///
/// impl<C: Codec> Query<C> for MyQuery {
///     ...
/// }
/// ```
///
/// here is the list of [`Query`]s that we already implemented:
/// * [`TermQuery`]
/// * [`BooleanQuery`]
/// * [`BoostQuery`]
/// * [`PhraseQuery`]
/// * [`PointRangeQuery`](point_range/struct.PointRangeQuery.html)
/// * [`ConstantScoreQuery`](match_all/struct.ConstantScoreQuery.html)

/// - A `Weight` is constructed by a top-level query, given a `IndexSearcher`
/// `Query#crate_weight()`.
/// - The `get_value_for_normalization()` method is called on the `Weight`
/// to compute the query normalization factor `Similarity#query_norm()` of the
/// query clauses contained in the query.
/// - The query normalization factor is passed to `normalize()`. At this point the weighting is
///   complete.
